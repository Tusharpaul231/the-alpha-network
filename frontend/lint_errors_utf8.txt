ESLint: 8.57.1

ESLint couldn't find a configuration file. 
To set up a configuration file for this 
project, please run:

    npm init @eslint/config

ESLint looked for configuration files in D:\M
y-Projects\the-alpha-network\frontend\src 
and its ancestors. If it found none, it then 
looked in your home directory.

If you think you already have a 
configuration file or if you need more help, 
please stop by the ESLint Discord server:
